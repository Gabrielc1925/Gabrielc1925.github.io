This has overall been a very easy task thanks to all the work done by the team who developed this site layout. Many thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">Al-Folio</a> team for making this a very intuitive and pain free process.</p> <p>I especially appreciate that there are wonderful example files for all the different types of content that I might want to write. The auto-checking Github Actions and the thorough README file and accompanying documentation made this whole process pain free. There are a couple formatting issues on my CV related to dates that I need to figure out, but other than that everything worked perfectly out of the box.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <p>My next task is going to be continuing to work on the collaborative project I have going with a few friends, the goal of which is to build a website template for easy deployment by a mosque. I will be learning more coding and development-centric skills to enable that, and may post separate projects for each language as I learn more.</p> <p>For now, you can follow along with my projects using the menu at the top of the page. Info on my main project can be found in the <a href="/projects/Masjid_Website">Masjid_Website </a> project page.</p> <p>Follow along with me as I learn and pave a path forward!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="website-status"/><category term="website,"/><category term="status-update"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Website formatting complete.
