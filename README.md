This is a repository for the website used to host my CV and project list. I hope that everything is organized easily so that you can find the information you need to learn more about my life and work history. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns related to work history or job opportunities in related fields.

## Source

This page was made from the Al-Folio theme project: [Al-Folio README page](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/README.md)

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
