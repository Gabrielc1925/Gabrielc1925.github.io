## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://github.com/Gabrielc1925/Gabrielc1925.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/kubernetes_unsplash_large.jpg)

This project was undertaken so that I could have a place to share my work and also as a good first project to use for other practices later.

I used it to display my resume and my portfolio, and then I took the resulting website and used it to practice learning several other technologies such as Packer, Ansible, and Terraform. I deployed it on AWS and practiced several things there, and then put that work into the portfolio on the site as well.
