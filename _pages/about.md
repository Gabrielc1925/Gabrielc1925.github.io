I was born in New Mexico, and moved to the Denver Metro Area with my family in 2021. I went to University of New Mexico and graduated with my Doctorate of Pharmacy degree in 2017. From there I worked as a pharmacy manager in New Mexico for 4 years, and then moved to Denver and worked as a pharmacy manager there for another 3 years.

I have always been interested in tech, and wanted to work in coding or programming of some sort. I honestly don't know why I didn't do it after high school, I assume just because I did not know anyone else in that field and was afraid to make a blind leap without someone knowledgeable to guide me.

At this point in my life, I am finally making the change I should have made two decades ago. With the guidance of some close friends, I have embarked on my journey to start a career in DevOps. I have been training asynchronously with them for about a year now (as of April 2024), learning Linux, Docker, GitHub, and working on small projects to get to know CI/CD and development lifecycle practices. Now my goal is to take a more serious look at what kind of medium size projects I can take on to show potential employers that I am ready to step up and work in a full time environment.

I hope to leverage my years of management experience and my aptitude for customer interaction to move quickly into leadership roles where I can interface between the dev team and customers. The end goal is always to ensure that product rollout goes smoothly, the dev team feels heard and appreciated, and the customer is satisfied with the end product.

As we all know, automation is key when it comes to smooth development and implementation, and I am looking forward to learning all the different automation tools that can be used to get different (or the same) end results.
