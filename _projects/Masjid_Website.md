This is a project that we have been working on in our spare time for a few months.

You can see our project page on [GitHub](https://github.com/three-knots/Masjid_Website).

Our goal is to create an easy to use website template that can be easily deployed by someone tech-savy in a few minutes so that small mosques can easily and affordably create websites for their communities.

I will be taking a more active role in the development side of things, so that I can learn more about the various coding languanges and the front-end vs back-end implementation of them.

There may be other small projects listed on my projects page as I learn these different languages, but this shall be the main culmination of my efforts.

Bear with me as the webste format may change while I figure things out further.

Thank you for being here and for your patience as I learn and grow.
