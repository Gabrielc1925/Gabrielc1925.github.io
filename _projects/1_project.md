This shall be the first project that I embark on here on this platform.

I am going to be using project suggestions from [Medium](https://www.medium.com), as I think that will allow me to learn in whatever direction I choose, and will give me a good framework that will guide me in a direction without completely holding my hand.

The most difficult part, for me, will be figuring out how to document this effectively on this page so that I can explain what I did and what I learned from it.

Updates will be posted as I get things figured out. Links and images will be posted when I can, after I have determined the safety of doing so.

Thank you for reading!
