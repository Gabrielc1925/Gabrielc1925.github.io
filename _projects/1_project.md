This shall be the first project that I embark on here on this platform.
I have used a site template to get this site up and running quickly, and it worked beautifully thanks to the hard work of the people who developed the template.

My new goal is to figure out how to make the completed site propogate to AWS where I have a custom domain and I had previously had a resume hosted. My current setup at AWS is very lackluster compared to the polished product here on [Github](https://gabrielc1925.github.io/), and I would love to update it to make the most of the domain I paid money for and the work that I put in here.
