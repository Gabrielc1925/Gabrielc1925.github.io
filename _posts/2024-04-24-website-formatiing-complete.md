I have completed the initial task of getting the website set up. This has overall been a very easy task thanks to all the work done by the team who developed this site layout. Many thanks to the [Al-Folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) team for making this a very intuitive and pai free process.

I especially appreciate that there are wonderful example files for all the different types of content that I might want to write. The auto-checking Github Actions and the thorough README file and accompanying documentation made this whole process pain free. There are a couple formatting issues on my CV related to dates that I need to figure out, but other than that everything worked perfectly out of the box.

## Next Steps

My next task is going to be deciding on a first project to document here, and then getting it set up. I'm thinking that I would like to use the AWS architecture that I already have set up for website hosting, and the domain name that I already paid for, and I would like to figure out a way to have this completed site replicated there automatically. I'm sure I could do it manually, but I want to use automation tools to make this a seamless process that removes the possibility of user error from the process.

I will post a first project page to show the plan, and will update it when it is complete.
<a href="/projects/1_project">Project 1</a> will be the title for now, but I intend to name it something more elegant and intuitive later.
